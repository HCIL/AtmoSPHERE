Zen gardens are a peaceful way to visualize space and tranquillity. Our project seeks to connect the zen garden to the room in which it sits; imbuing the garden with properties of the room's occupants. In this way, the zen garden becomes not just a visualization of an ideal space and tranquillity but of the actual tranquillity of it's surroundings.
